title: "Participatory Icons Specification for Expressing Intentions in Computer-Mediated Communications"
abstract: "Web-mediated conversations require treating intentions more explicitly. Literature lacks adequate design methods and interactive mechanisms to support users in the sharing of intentions. This research assumes that icons representing emotions play a central role as means for aiding users to convey intentions in communication tasks. This article proposes a method to specify emoticons for representing the users' intentions, named ``intenticons''. The work explores Speech Act Theory and Semiotics in a conceptual framework to structure classes of intentions. We conduct participatory activities to experiment the method with 40 users. The obtained intenticons were evaluated with a different set of users to reveal their effectiveness. The obtained results suggest the feasibility of the method to select and enhance emoticons for intention expression. Evaluations point out that most of the achieved intenticons indicate an acceptable degree of representativeness for the intention classes."
