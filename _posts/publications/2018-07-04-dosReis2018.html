title: "Design of Interactive Mechanisms to Support the Communication of Users’ Intentions"
abstract: "The communication and interpretation of users’ intentions play a key role in collaborative web discussions. However, existing computational mechanisms are not effective in supporting the expression of intentions during collaborations. In this article, we present the design of interactive mechanisms that allow users to make their intentions explicit. The study considered the domain of collaborative forums of software developers. The mechanisms design was based on semiotic principles and artifacts. They were implemented and evaluated to assess their effectiveness. We investigated to which extent the mechanisms support users in the task of interpreting message exchanges in forums that make use of the mechanisms. The results reveal the suitability of the designed interface elements, enabling more meaningful and successful communication."
