title: "Constructing Knowledge Graphs from Textual Documents for Scientific Literature Analysis"
abstract: "The amount of publications a researcher must absorb has been increasing over the last years. Consequently, among so many options, it is hard for them to identify interesting documents to read related to their studies. Researchers usually search for review articles to understand how a scientific field is organized and to study its state of the art. This option can be unavailable or outdated depending on the studied area. Usually, they have to do such laborious task of background research manually.
Recent researches have developed mechanisms to assist researchers in understanding the structure of scientific fields. However, those mechanisms focus on recommending relevant articles to researchers or supporting them in understanding how a scientific field is organized considering documents that belong to it. These methods limit the field understanding, not allowing researchers to study the underlying concepts and relations that compose a scientific field and its sub-areas. 
This Ms.c. thesis proposes a framework to structure, analyze, and track the evolution of a scientific field at a concept level. Given a set of textual documents as research papers, it first structures a scientific field as a knowledge graph using its detected concepts as vertices. Then, it automatically identifies the field's main sub-areas, extracts their keyphrases, and studies their relations. Our framework enables to represent the scientific field in distinct time-periods. It allows to compare its representations and identify how the field's areas changed over time.
We evaluate each step of our framework representing and analyzing scientific data from distinct fields of knowledge in case studies. Our findings indicate the success in detecting the sub-areas based on the generated graph from natural language documents. We observe similar outcomes in the different case studies, indicating that our approach is applicable to distinct domains. This research also contributes with a web-based software tool that allows researchers to use the proposed framework graphically. By using our application, researchers can have an overview analysis of how a scientific field is structured and how it evolved."
