title: "TangiSAM: Tangible Artifacts for Evaluation of Affective States"
abstract: "Evaluation of affective states is essential for assessing people's perceptions during activities and interaction experience. There is, however, a lack of playful and accessible proposals enabling children for example to complete evaluation activities thoroughly. This paper proposes the TangiSAM, a technological environment with tangible three-dimensional manikins representing the affective state in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal and dominance. We present the results of a study conducted to investigate the usage of our proposal in a real-world setting with children and teachers. Obtained results showed that the TangiSAM was more effective than other approaches for evaluation."
