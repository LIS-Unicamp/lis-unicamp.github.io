title: "Inquiring Evaluation Aspects of Universal Design and Natural Interaction in Socioenactive Scenarios"
abstract: "New technologies and ubiquitous systems present new forms and modalities of interaction. Evaluating such systems, particularly in the novel socioenactive scenario, poses a difficult issue, as existing instruments do not capture all aspects intrinsic to such scenario. One of the key aspects is the wide range of characteristics and needs of both users and technology involved. In this paper, we are concerned with aspects of both Universal Design (UD) and Natural User Interfaces (NUIs). We present a case study where we applied, within a socioenactive scenario, evaluation instruments relying on principles and heuristics from these areas. The scenario involved six children from a hospital that treats craniofacial deformities, playing in a rich interactive environment with displays and plush animals that respond to hugs. Our results based on the analysis of the evaluation conducted in the case study suggest informed recommendations of how to use the evaluation instruments in the context of socioenactive systems and their limitations."
