title: "Finding Relations Between Requirements for Healthcare Information Systems Use in Hospitals: A Study on EMRAM and JCI"
abstract: "EMRAM is a maturity model which goal is to measure the adoption and utilization of HIS functions in hospitals. However, maturity models regarding HIS in healthcare settings are not comprehensive and lack detail. Therefore, it is important for EMRAM to learn from other sources of HIS evaluation in healthcare organizations, such as JCI. In addition, it is important to understand how to adapt processes and implement technologies that can ensure compliance with the requirements established by both bodies. In this paper, we carry out an evaluation to identify relations between JCI and EMRAM requirements. We extracted EMRAM and JCI requirements and identified relations between them, with further validation by specialist. We identified 127 relations between JCI requirements and EMRAM and/or HIS. Six JCI requirements specifically related to IT are not currently required by EMRAM and could be used to promote the evolution of the maturity model. We also identified the JCI requirements that can be supported by HIS, which can be used by healthcare organizations to facilitate the management of JCI and EMRAM conformance."
