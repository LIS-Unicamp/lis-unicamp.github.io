title: "Participatory Design of System Messages in Petroleum Fields Management Software"
abstract: "Users face difficulties in understanding the progress of simulation tasks in oil reservoirs. It is necessary to turn clear to users when some task suffers errors because this is time consuming. In this paper, we propose the use of participatory design to conceive Application System Messages (ASMs) in software tools implemented to support studies related to Numerical Simulation and Management of Petroleum Reservoirs. We explored braindrawing and brainwriting techniques to acquire early concepts for a redesign of the ASMs' presentation and content. Our obtained results indicate that the use of participatory practices is useful to improve the redesign of ASMs in our study context."
