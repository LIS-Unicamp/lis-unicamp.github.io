abstract: "Color blind people face various difficulties interacting with web systems. Interface adaptation techniques designed to recoloring images and web interfaces may deal with several color blindness visualization issues. However, different situations, preferences and individual needs make complex choosing the most suitable recoloring technique. This article proposes an original algorithm to compute similarity between colors. We aim to support the decision process of select the most suitable adaptation technique according to the type of color blindness and interaction context. The algorithm ponders arguments for taking the users’ preferences and limitations into account. Our experimental analysis implement various configurations by testing the weights in the color distance calculation according to the colorblindness type. The obtained results reveal the advantages of considering the type of colorblindness in the color similarity computation."
