title: "Updating ontology alignments in life sciences based on new concepts and their context"
abstract: "Ontologies and their associated mappings in life sciences play a central role in several semantic-enabled tasks. However, the continuous evolution of these ontologies requires updating existing concept alignments. Whereas mapping maintenance techniques have mostly handled revision and removal type of ontology changes, the addition of concepts demands further studies. This article proposes a technique to refine a set of established mappings based on the evolution of biomedical ontologies. We investigate ways of suggesting correspondences with the new version of the ontology without applying a matching operation to the whole set of ontology entities. Obtained results explore the neighbourhood of concepts in the alignment process to update mapping sets. Our experimental evaluation with several versions of aligned biomedical ontologies shows the effectiveness in considering the context of new concepts."
