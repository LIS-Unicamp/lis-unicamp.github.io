title: "Experimental studies for revealing key factors of cross-language ontology alignments"
abstract: "Cross-language alignment between ontologies is relevant for the interoperability of systems in specific domains, such as in the life science domain.
Although the literature has proposed techniques for the alignment of ontologies
described in different languages, the influence of linguistic characteristics from
domain-specific ontologies on such alignments has barely been appraised. This
study proposes a series of experiments based on real-world mappings to understand the matching between ontologies in different languages. It investigates
the role of a pivot-language related to the domain for the purpose of a fully
automatic cross-language alignment. In particular, we analyse the influence of
syntactic and semantic similarity methods and the structure of terms denoting
concepts in ontologies. Experimental results, focused on the life science domain,
indicate useful factors to take into account in the design of matching algorithms
for domain-specific cross-language alignment."
