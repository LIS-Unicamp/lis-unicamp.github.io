title: "Investigating Aspects of Affectibility for Universal Access in Socioenactive System Scenarios"
abstract: "The design process focused on universal access must be guided by a set of relevant recommendations to improve interaction design and evaluation. The interactions in socioenactive systems intensify the emphasis in social, corporal and affective aspects. This article develops an affective study in the context of socioenactive scenarios. Our objective is to analyse the Design Principles of Affectibility (PAff) towards universal access into socioenactive systems. The analysis was conducted in a workshop realized at a hospital where the participants involved kids who were under rehabilition regarding face and skull disorders. Relying on the analisys applying PAff, we generated a set of recomendations which might be useful to designers for promoting universal access in socioenactive systems."
