abstract: "Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying a set of phrases that best represent a natural language document. It is a fundamental and challenging task that assists publishers to index and recommend relevant documents to readers. In this article, we introduce C-Rank, a novel unsupervised approach to automatically extract keyphrases from single documents by using concept linking. Our method explores Babelfy to identify candidate keyphrases, which are weighted based on heuristics and their centrality inside a co-occurrence graph where keyphrases appear as vertices. It improves the results obtained by graph-based techniques without training nor background data inserted by users. Evaluations are performed on SemEval and INSPEC datasets, producing competitive results with state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, C-Rank generates intermediate structures with semantically annotated data that can be used to analyze larger textual compendiums, which might improve domain understatement and enrich textual representation methods."

  abstract="The design of visual analytics tools for facilitating human-data interaction (HDI) plays a key role to help people identifying useful knowledge from large masses of data. Designing data visualization based on guidelines is relevant. However, it is necessary to further promote the engagement of people in evaluation activities in the design process. Stakeholders need to comprehend the guidelines to help with the evaluation results and design decisions. In this paper, we propose participatory evaluation practices based on HDI design guidelines. The practices aim to create the conditions to participants from any profile collaborate with the design guidelines evaluation. The practices were used on a design problem involving interactions with coordinated visualization. The context of application was a visual analytic tool supporting decisions related to the production strategy in oil reservoirs with the participation of key stakeholders. The results indicate that participants were able to understand the design guidelines and took advantage from them in the design decisions.",
