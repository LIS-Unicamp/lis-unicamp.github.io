title: "EVOCROS: Results for OAEI 2018"
abstract: "This paper describes EVOCROS, a cross-lingual ontology alignment system suited to create mappings between ontologies described in different natural language. Our tool combines semantic and syntactic similarity measures in a weighted average metric. The semantic is computed via NASARI vectors used together with BabelNet, which is a domain-neutral semantic network. The tool employs automatic translation to a pivot language to consider the similarity. EVOCROS was tested and obtained high quality alignment in the Multifarm dataset. We discuss the experimented configurations and the achieved results in OAEI 2018. This is our first participation in OAEI."
