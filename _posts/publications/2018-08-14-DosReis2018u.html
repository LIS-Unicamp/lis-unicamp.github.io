title: "Understanding interface recoloring aspects by colorblind people: a user study"
abstract: "The current web technologies make intensive the use of colors in web pages. Nowadays, colors are essential in the design of interfaces and play a central role in the distinction and comprehension of information. However, this affects colorblind users, i.e., those who have difficulties in recognizing or distinguishing colors. This paper presents a user study involving colorblind people to empirically investigate several aspects related to the recoloring of web interfaces. We aim to detect limitations, barriers, and needs about these users’ interaction with web pages. Our employed evaluation investigates indicators of satisfaction (contentment) and pleasantness (enjoyable) for several scenarios of interface recoloring adaptation. We found a ranking of application for interface adaptation techniques with the use of recoloring algorithms. The obtained results reveal the advantages of considering the colorblind individual’s needs and preferences for the development of adaptive systems. Our contribution can enhance web interface accessibility based on user interface adaptation techniques."
