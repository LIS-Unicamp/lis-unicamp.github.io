title: "EVOCROS: Results for OAEI 2019"
abstract: "This paper describes the updates in EVOCROS, a crosslingual ontology alignment system suited to create mappings between ontologies described in different natural language. Our tool combines syntactic and semantic similarity measures with information retrieval techniques. The semantic similarity is computed via NASARI vectors used together with BabelNet, which is a domain-neutral semantic network. In particular, we investigate the use of rank aggregation techniques in the cross-lingual ontology alignment task. The tool employs automatic translation to a pivot language to consider the similarity. EVOCROS was tested and obtained high quality alignment in the Multifarm dataset. We discuss the experimented configurations and the achieved results in OAEI 2019. This is our second participation in OAEI."
