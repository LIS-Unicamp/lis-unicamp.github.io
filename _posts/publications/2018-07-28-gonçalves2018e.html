title: "Enhancing Problem Clarification Artifacts with Online Deliberation"
abstract: "Information system design demands understanding requirements from diversified stakeholders. As an initial step, the problem clarification is essential to obtain a shared view of the involved problems and solutions. Several techniques have been proposed and practiced by the systems engineering community for problem clarification. While existing literature has brought problem clarification artifacts via a online computational system, stakeholders still lack means of meaning negotiation practices that usually happen in face-to-face meetings. This paper proposes a deliberation model integrated to the online use of problem clarification artifacts. The deliberation provides a collaborative process for building common ground for reflection. The proposed model illustrates the possibilities of deliberation in statements created in three artefacts of the Organizational Semiotics: Stakeholder Identification, Evaluation Frame and Semiotic Framework."
