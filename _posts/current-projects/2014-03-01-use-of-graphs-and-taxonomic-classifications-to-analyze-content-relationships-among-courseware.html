<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Project Overview</strong></span></h2>
<p>Lecturers and students need access to various educational materials to understand a new topic or to update their knowledge. The viewing of relationships among topics facilitates this process. However, the increasing amount of educational material available in repositories on the Internet hampers finding the appropriate content. In our research we will assist users in finding relevant courseware content in multimedia educational repositories. The project is defining and developing algorithms to find, analyze, extract hidden relationships among courseware content. The project concentrates on material presented in lectures, namely slides used during a lecture and videos of the lecture itself. These relationships will assist in the learning process and facilitate the handling of materials that are (indirectly) related to each other.</p>

            <p>The main goal of this research is design a methodology that combines a suite of tools to integrate courseware by highlighting the presence of relationships among the content covered by these courseware. We use graph databases as the basis of data management and to navigate among the data. The approach to classify the educational material combines ESA algorithms and the ACM Computing Classification System</p>
