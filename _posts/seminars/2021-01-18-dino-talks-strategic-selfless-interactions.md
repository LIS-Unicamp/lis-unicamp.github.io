Humans are unique animals, cooperating in a scale unrivalled by any other species. We built societies composed of non-kins, and empirical results have shown that people can perform costly actions in the benefit of others. On the other hand, humans also compete among themselves leading at times to negative outcomes, such as the overuse of Earth's natural resources.  Yet, competition between economic agents underlies the well functioning of markets, and its destabilisation -- such as in an unbalanced distribution of market power -- can harm trade efficiency. 
Accordingly, analysing how people cooperate and compete is fundamental for the understanding of human behaviour. In this talk, I will present an account of the work performed during my PhD thesis exploring this subject.

#### Speaker: [Felipe Maciel Cardoso](https://fmcardoso.github.io/)

Felipe Maciel Cardoso has recently obtained his PhD at the University of Zaragoza, Spain.  His research activity is focused on studying the laws that promote human cooperation and on assessing how individuals react to social dilemmas that pose a basic conflict between the individual and the collective. He got both his undergraduate and Masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science at the University of Campinas, Brazil.
