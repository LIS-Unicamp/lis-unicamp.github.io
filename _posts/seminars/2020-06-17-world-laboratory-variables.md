We are starting a series in which you will be introduced to simple and advanced concepts for interpreting the world through Science. We will transform your kitchen into the first exploration laboratory. You will understand why variables are important for scientists (and also for your recipes). After this video, you will learn a little more about Science, the world, and also about cooking.
