This talk is part of a series in which we introduce both simple and advanced concepts for interpreting the world through Science. 

In this second episode of the series, we will take a further step in understanding the variables. We will discuss different ways of dealing with very complex problems like that of treating diseases. More specifically, we will talk about plants and ask the question: does a plant can heal us from a specific disease?
